List of IRQs:
0: System Timer
1: Keyboard controller
2: <Must not be used: Used to cascade signals from IRQ 8-15>
3: Serial Port Controller for COM2 (Shared with COM4)
4: Serial Port Controller for COM1 (Shared with COM3)
5: LPT Port 2 or sound card
6: Floppy Disk Controller
7: LPT Port 1 or Printers or for any parallel port if a printer isn't present.

Slave PIC:
8: RTC Timer
9: Left open (Or SCSI Host Adapter)
10: Left open (Or SCSI Or NIC)
11: See 10
12: Mouse on PS/2 connector
13: Math Co-Procesor or integrated FPU or inter-processor interrupt (use depends on OS)
14: Primary ATA channel
15: Secondary ATA channel

Info: ATA interface usually serves hard disks and CD drives.
