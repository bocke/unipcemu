Getting UniPCemu to compile on SDL2 with MSys2:

Note: "these are literals, don't include the "-characters when typing such a literal".

Command are executed by typing them and pressing enter. Instead of typing, you can also paste it from the clipboard using the Shift+Insert keyboard combination or right click and click paste.

First: Installing and configuration of the compiler:
1. Install MSYS2. This can be found at http://repo.msys2.org/distrib/msys2-x86_64-latest.exe for 64-bit systems and http://repo.msys2.org/distrib/msys2-i686-latest.exe for 32-bit systems.
2. Start the plain MSYS2 shell(called MSYS2 MSYS in the start menu).
3. Execute: "pacman -Syuu". When asked ":: Proceed with installation? [Y/n]", type "Y" and press enter.
4. It might give a warning ending with exit. When it does so, close the window and repeat steps 2-4. When closing the window, it will say "Processes are running in session: Close anyway?". Click OK in that case.
5. The second try executing the command above (if done correctly), the updates have finished and you will return to the prompt. Close the window and restart MSYS2 MSYS.
6. Type "pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-i686-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain \" and press enter.
7. It will show a ">"-prompt. Type "git subversion mercurial \" and press enter.
8. It will show another ">"-prompt. Type "mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake" and press enter.
9. It will show a list, ending with "Enter a selection (default=all):" prompt. Type enter.
10. It will show another list, ending with the same prompt as before. Type enter again.
11. The same prompt will show again. Type enter again.
12. It will show a large list and ask ":: Proceed with installation? [Y/n] ". Type "Y" and press enter.
13. Mount the correct mingw folder you want to use, or simply mount both to compile for x86(32-bit) and x64(64-bit):
13.1. x86 building: Execute: "mount 'PATHTOMSYS2\mingw32' /mingw32". Replace PATHTOMSYS2 with the location of your MSYS2 installation(the path entered during installation of MSYS2, like C:\msys64).
13.2. x64 building: Execute: "mount 'PATHTOMSYS2\mingw64' /mingw64". See above above step.
14. Close the MSYS2 prompt.

That concludes the setting up of the development environment(the compiler) itself. This is usually only done once(or when an update is needed).

Now, either when a new SDL2 version comes out, or when first installing, we need to install the library required to compile and run UniPCemu.

15. Download the SDL2 mingw development library from http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php . The current version is http://libsdl.org/release/SDL2-devel-2.0.5-mingw.tar.gz .
16. Extract the folders from the archive into your toolchains. The archive contains a .tar file(which is the actual archive itself). Within this tar file is a folder named SDL2-2.0.5. Open this directory.
16.1. x86 building: Copy the i686-w64-mingw32 directory to the msys2\mingw32 folder, replacing the folder of the same name that's already there.
16.2. x64 building: Copy the x86_64-mingw32 directory to the msys2\mingw64 folder.

SDL2_net(for networking support, optional):
17. Download the SDL2_net mingw development library from the SDL_net website. The current version is https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/release/SDL2_net-devel-2.0.1-mingw.tar.gz .
18. Extract the folders from the archive into your toolchains. The archive contains a .tar file(which is the actual archive itself). Within this tar file is a folder named SDL2_net-2.0.1. Open this directory.
18.1. x86 building: Copy the i686-w64-mingw32 directory to the msys2\mingw32 folder, replacing the folder of the same name that's already there.
18.2. x64 building: Copy the x86_64-mingw32 directory to the msys2\mingw64 folder.


19. Make sure to have this repository in a folder in the home directory of msys2(C:\msys64\home\<yourusername>). For example: msys2\home\<yourusername>\unipcemu contains androidprompt.bat when properly set up(the androidprompt.bat that's in the root of the cloned repository).

Finally, building UniPCemu or updating it to the latest version(after pulling the changes from the repository).

20. Open the 32-bit or 64-bit MSys2(MSYS MinGW 32-bit or MSYS MinGW 64-bit), depending on what version you want to compile.
21. Change into the repository's unipcemu directories from the home (~) directory, e.g. "cd unipcemu\unipcemu" when using the folder name as described above. The first unipcemu can be replaced with the name you've given the folder of the repository(it's the repository folder itself).
22. Compile the project using "make win build SDL2 mingw32" for 32-bit versions and "make win build SDL2 mingw64 x64" for 64-bit versions. The compiled program(UniPCemu_x86/64.exe and required SDL2.dll will appear in the projects_build/unipcemu directory in the home folder of msys(so at C:\msys64\home\<yourusername>\projects_build\unipcemu, when using the default installation path of MSYS2). Add " SDL2_net" after SDL2 to compile with networking support.
